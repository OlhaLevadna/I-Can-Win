I walked alone beneath the silver sky,  
The wind was cold, but I kept walking by.  
A thousand dreams were dancing in my head,  
But not a word of all the things I said.

I saw your face among the city lights,  
A fleeting glimpse of better nights.  
Your voice, a whisper in the rain,  
Calling me back through all the pain.
